              P. In the United States, Dynata has an obligation to: (i) provide

              or more in a tax year; and (ii) file a 1099-Misc form with the
              United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for such payments.
              In addition, Dynata will provide you with a completed 1099-Misc
              form for your tax compliance purposes. As a result, please see the
              following: (1) If you have received payments of $599 during a tax
              year, your account will be suspended (i.e., you will not be able
              to receive further payments and will not be able to complete or

              year unless and until you provide Dynata with a completed and
              verified W-9 form. (2) If you have received payments of $600 or
              more during a tax year, your account will be suspended

            <p className="mb-10">
              A. Restriction. Dynata employees and their Immediate Family
              Member(s) (as defined herein) are not eligible to receive any
              payments, prizes or incentives for using, participating in or
              accessing the Applications/Services. For the purpose of this
              Section 19, the term “Immediate Family Member(s)” includes
              parents, spouses, children or significant others (i.e.
              girlfriends/boyfriends, domestic partners and spousal
              equivalents).

              the violation of the terms of this Section 19 by a Dynata employee
              and/or hos/her Immediate Family Member(s) is a violation of
              Dynata’s standards of conduct and any such violation may subject
              the employee to discipline, including, but not limited to,
              termination of employment.
